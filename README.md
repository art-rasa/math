# math

This is a Fortran module containing mathematical procedures. Currently implemented are:

* *gcDenom*: returns the greatest common denominator of two integer numbers.
* *numDigits*: returns the number of digits in an integer number.

At the moment the codes do not feature any tests.

This library was compiled with [GFortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/) and packaged with [FPM](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm).
